# ArvoreAVL

This is a colege project to implement a AVL tree.

## ðŸŒ³ What is a AVL tree?
An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree that maintains a balanced height, named after its inventors, Adelson-Velsky and Landis. The balance property is maintained through rotations, which are operations that change the shape of the tree while preserving the relative order of the nodes. AVL trees provide guaranteed logarithmic time for search, insert, and delete operations, but require balancing operations that add some overhead.
